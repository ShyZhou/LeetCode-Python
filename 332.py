# Reconstruct Itinerary

# Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

# Note:

# If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
# All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
# You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

# Example 1:
# Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
# Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]

# Example 2:
# Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
# Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
# Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
#              But it is larger in lexical order.

# 欧拉路径的定义：In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph which visits every edge exactly once.

# 求欧拉路径的一个经典算法：Hierholzer

# path = []

# DFS(u):
#     While (u存在未被访问的边e(u,v))
#         mark边e(u,v)为访问
#         DFS(v)
#     End
#     path.pushLeft(u)
