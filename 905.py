# Sort Array By Parity

# Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.

# You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

# Example 1:

# Input: [3,1,2,4]
# Output: [2,4,3,1]
# The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

# II

# Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

# Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

# You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

# Example 1:

# Input: [4,2,5,7]
# Output: [4,5,2,7]
# Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
